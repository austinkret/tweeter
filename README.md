# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. This project helped in building some HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, and AJAX front-end skills while also including some solid backend components as well!

In my project, I got use my design skills to really test out some design features I've been wanting to implement. The biggest feature that I wanted to include was Dark Mode! After lots of trial and error I fainally got it working (probably not in the most efficient way possible) but I'm still proud!

I also cleaned up the header and nav bar area on sub 1024px displays by adding an Intersection Observer. This feature kicks is right as the nav bar is about to cross into the body, and adds a branded bar for better readability. 

Enjoy playing around with it!
